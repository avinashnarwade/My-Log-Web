# My-Log-Web:
A Django website project is a web application built using Django, a high-level Python web framework. Django provides a robust set of tools for rapid development, emphasizing the reuse of code, security, and scalability. The project typically follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, where:

Model defines the data structure.
View handles the logic and interactions.
Template manages the presentation layer.
Django projects often come with a built-in admin panel, authentication system, and support for URL routing, database management, and templating. These features allow developers to efficiently create dynamic, database-driven websites.
